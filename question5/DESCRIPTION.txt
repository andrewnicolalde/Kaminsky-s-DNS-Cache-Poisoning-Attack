While I'm sure some solutions to question 5 include more clever ways of poisoning the cache, such as exploiting
imperfections in the random number generator that dnsserver uses to generate query IDs, my solution was far simpler.

Simply put, I guess the query ID by generating a random number between 0 and 2^16 - 1 or 65535, and sent that just after
I had sent a query. After I wasn't getting anywhere after around an hour, I thought "How can I improve this program, which
uses brute force to solve a problem?" The answer came in a flash: "with more brute force!" So I ran the program in 6
processes and lo and behold, I got lucky! I'm so sorry attack server... I'm so sorry.

The secret for question 5 is 8cd3ddef121f892ae2cf886c92717cd32961e857d72bfd91812b909f50233f19
