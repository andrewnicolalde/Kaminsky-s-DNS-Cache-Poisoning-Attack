# What is this?

These are my submissions for the second assignment for Computer & Network Security, a second-year undergraduate
information security course at Royal Holloway, University of London.

During the assignment, we replicate [Kaminsky's DNS cache poisoning attack](http://unixwiz.net/techtips/iguide-kaminsky-dns-vuln.html)
within a private vulnerable environment (this attack is long-since patched IRL) which was set up for the course.

Feel free to have a look around and if there's some way you can improve my implementation (I'm sure there are many such ways)
then please submit a pull request or create an issue!
