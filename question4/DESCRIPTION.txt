The key to 4 is to exploit the race condition discovered in the Kaminski attack. All you do to get this is to ask
the vulnerable dns server for a random subdomain (in my case this was done manually by calling dig on a random subdomain
of bankofrhul.co.uk each time), and then immediately flood the server with forged answers like those created in
my answer to question 3. In the event that this does not work the first time around, simply regenerate a new random
subdomain, perform the query using it, flood the server with fraudulent responses and repeat until you win!
