The dns server sends all recursive queries over port 40043.

I wrote the solution to question 3 using a library called scapy (http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/)

This is an amazing little tool that allows you to easily and eloquently create & layer protocols without the use of hex!

I actually had to SCP the .deb for Scapy over to the attack server via teaching and install it manually,
which was a pain.

Essentially, I crafted a DNS response which sits inside a UDP packet addressed to port 40043 (which dnsserver uses to
send recursive queries and receive and their answers), which itself sits inside an IP datagram, whose header has a
forged sender IP address of 10.0.0.1, which is the IP of ns.bankofrhul.co.uk, the authoritative nameserver for the
bankofrhul.co.uk zone.

The secret for question 3 is a1a809f854e81cd6e959ac849da489c384465bcec70d4235d639b758f6f1f3ad.
